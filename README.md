# Next.js App Guide

## Starting the Next.js App

To start the Next.js app, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root folder.
2. Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Once the installation is complete, start the development server with:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Wait until the app has started. You will see a message indicating that the app is running on a local address (usually http://localhost:3000).
5. Open the specified address in your web browser to view the app.

## Using the Next.js App

Here are some tips for using and developing with the Next.js app:

1. **Hot Reloading**: The app supports hot reloading. Any changes you make to your code will be immediately reflected in the browser without needing to manually refresh.

2. **File-based Routing**: Next.js uses file-based routing. Create new pages by adding files to the `pages` directory.

3. **API Routes**: Create API endpoints by adding files to the `pages/api` directory.

4. **Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Utilize Next.js's powerful rendering methods by using `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, or `getStaticPaths` in your page components.

5. **CSS Support**: Next.js supports CSS Modules out of the box. Use `.module.css` files for component-scoped styles.

6. **Image Optimization**: Use the `next/image` component for automatic image optimization.

7. **Environment Variables**: Use `.env.local` file to set environment-specific variables.

8. **Production Build**: When you're ready to deploy, run:
   ```
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

By leveraging these features, you can develop scalable and performant web applications with Next.js.

# Storybook Guide

## Starting Storybook

To start Storybook, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root folder.
2. Run the following command:
   ```
   npm run storybook
   ```
3. Wait until Storybook has started. You will see a message indicating that Storybook is running on a local address (usually http://localhost:6006).
4. Open the specified address in your web browser to view the Storybook interface.

## Using Storybook

Here are some tips for using Storybook effectively:

1. **Navigate between components**: Use the sidebar to browse through different components and their stories.

2. **View different states**: Each component can have multiple stories showing different states or variants. Click on these to see how the component looks in various scenarios.

3. **Adjust props**: Use the "Controls" tab to dynamically change props and see how the component reacts in real-time.

4. **Documentation**: Read the component documentation in the "Docs" tab to understand how the component should be used.

5. **Test responsiveness**: Use the viewport tool to see how components behave on different screen sizes.

6. **Accessibility**: Check the accessibility of your components using the built-in accessibility tools in Storybook.

7. **Create new stories**: To add new stories, create or edit `.stories.js` or `.stories.tsx` files in your component folder.

By using Storybook, you can develop and test UI components in isolation, leading to more robust and well-designed interfaces.
